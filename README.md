# Top100

This gem allows the user to interact with the Billboard's Top 100 via the command line interface. Users can acquire a real time list of trending songs and acquire more information about the artists responsible for the works. Users can also open up Spotify links in their default browser of any songs they wish to hear. Information is acquired through multiple sources, including RSS feeds, the Spotify API, and the Nokogiri gem and OpenUri for data scraping purposes.

## Usage
